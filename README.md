# student_scores

## Final Project
Schools all around the world always seem to follow some kind of standardized teaching. I sometimes feel like this way of education does not help with the way the students develop their interests and advance their skills.
In this project, we will research why the education system educate in such a way. We will look at test scores all across the country to see how it affects the education system.
